This application used a pre-existing Apple Vision API that had a sole, hard-coded purpose to detect phone numbers via RegEx.
Our team has since redesigned and completely rehashed the machine learning logic, removing RegEx character processing, 
and modified its purpose entirely. This is to aid individuals with dyslexia. 
Using the iOS camera functionality, we utilize machine learning techniques to detect the correct characters, 
using search logic to ensure valid and speedy results.

USE:
Runs on iOS mobile devices utilizing the Apple Camera. 
Hover over a single line of text to convert it to Comic Sans, a dyslexic-friendly font!
